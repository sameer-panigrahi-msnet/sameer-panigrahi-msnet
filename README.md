I'm a full timer profession and along with my profession I keep trying to convert an idea into a reality ..I dont see if thats a small impact or a large but the fun part is almost every aspect I have failed so far. few ideas to I can proudly share 

These are all collaborated projects with Hardware integration done and the success was till a prototype. 


1 : Wisys : <Wireless system > An application where the data can be transferred from a remote place like how many units of electricity generated from a windmill.
  
2 : Transit : To Track goods when the shipment happens over Maritime Transport
